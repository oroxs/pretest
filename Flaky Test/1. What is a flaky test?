1. What is a flaky test?
Flaky test is a test with the same configuration but with the same configuration it can be successful or not, so there needs to be adjustments which usually do not require changes to the configuration such as adding delay.
2. An element in a website is using ajax/javascript to show the data (processed as
asynchronous). What do you do to test that element?
Wait Until Element Is Enabled, and setting delay x sec
3. A website page can only be accessed with CAPTCHA. How do you test that page?
CAPTCHA cannot be automated, i think web with CAPTCHA can't be automate becouse thats the main reason of CPATCHA to prevent robot automated our website. if CAPTCHA can be by passed than the CAPTCHA itself is failed.
there are some third party maybe can by pass CAPTCHA but for security resson im not recomended. for example the third party can collect our data.
